* PERF HACKS
- estimate collection size ahead of time to avoid 'growing' allocations
- different allocators: stdlib, tcmalloc, jemalloc
- glibc vs. musl
- c++ vs rust vs D
X tune custom types based on SPIRAL_N size
- tune nauty WORDSIZE and MAXN and lib variant based on SPIRAL_N size

* SCORE
X remove total count from score, use bin. coef. to validate collection size
- track multiples separately from uplinks
- normalization for de-duped nodes ?

* TESTS
- liveness test
- ancestor enumeration
- correctness with short types
- wtf is avx

* CORRECTNESS
- determine fudge factor for nauty de-duped layouts

* OUTPUT
- print dot format graphs
- print maxima systems of equations

* MULTITHREAD/PERSISTENT
X walk prospective nodes, read children, than do a single write - avoids contention for RMW of nodes, complicates enumeration in parallel, reduces liveness checks

* STATE REDUCTION
X trim score range where always dead or always alive
- keeps scores in ordered map, only store pointers to score in "layout" 

* D
- avoid growing score array
- don't use .value() on aa

* MAP (DE)ALLOC and SIZE OVERHEADS
X use mmap'd array
- use tree with custom allocation region that can be de-alloc'd in bulk
- use hash with custom key (don't hash object, use name)
- custom hash
- custom "allocator" from array of Layout structs
