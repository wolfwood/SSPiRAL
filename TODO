* PERF HACKS
- estimate collection size ahead of time to avoid 'growing' allocations
- different allocators: stdlib, tcmalloc, jemalloc
- glibc vs. musl
- c++ vs rust vs D
- tune custom types based on SPIRAL_N size
- tune nauty WORDSIZE and MAXN and lib variant based on SPIRAL_N size

* TESTS
- liveness test
- ancestor enumeration
- correctness with short types

* CORRECTNESS
- determine fudge factor for nauty de-duped layouts

* OUTPUT
- print dot format graphs
- print maxima systems of equations
